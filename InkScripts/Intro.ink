...
Cheers! For now you shall be honored by my company.
{CharName("Will")}
{Icon("Will01")}
Why should this be a honour?
We don't even know each other.
{CharName("Erza")}
{Icon("Erza03")}
Call me Erza.
Are you always this serious?
{CharName("Will")}
{Icon("Will01")}
Are you always this carefree?
{CharName("Erza")}
{Icon("Erza02")}
If you're worried about me, you should stay by my side... all night...
Just saying.
{Icon("Erza01")}
I feel like I'm going to become vulnerable in no time.
{CharName("Will")}
{Icon("Will01")}
You trust to easy on people...
Specially stranges.
Haven't your mother never told you to not trust on stranges?
{CharName("Erza")}
{Icon("Erza02")}
Is not a matter of trust, dear Will.
Is a matter of quality cognac.
{CharName("Will")}
{Icon("Will02")}
Fair enough.
And where did you get my name?
{CharName("Erza")}
{Icon("Erza03")}
The bill. On the table.
{CharName("Will")}
{Icon("Will02")}
Do you usually snoop on someone else's bill?
{CharName("Erza")}
{Icon("Erza02")}
Not only that.
I also have many other talents.
Let's go to a more reservated place...
{Icon("Erza01")}
... So I can tell you what else I have observed.

* [Go with him.]
{CharName("Will")}
{Icon("Will02")}
After you.
-> END
* [Send him off.]
{CharName("Will")}
{Icon("Will01")}
I'm sorry, I should go home early...
I think I've forgotten to walk my fish.
-> END
